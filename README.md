# jre-availability
This Python code serves several purposes. It begins by checking whether the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is available on the system and determines its version using the java_check() function. If JRE is not available, it attempts to silently install it from a specified installer path using the java_install() function. Following that, it generates a timestamp, creates a pandas DataFrame, and extracts the Java version information using regular expressions. Finally, the code exports this collected information, which includes the timestamp, Java version, and availability status, into a CSV file named "java-availability.csv."
